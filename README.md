# Depth-Object-Detector-DOD

Implementation of the novel method DOD for object detection with depth estimation integrated within the prediction heads of a convolutional neural network of one million of parameters.

The architecture of the proposed method is heavily inspired in the architecture and implementation of the object detector model YOLOv8 [1] implemented by [Ultralitycs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) under the AGPL 3.0 License.
